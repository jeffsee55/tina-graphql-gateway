By now it has sunk in that the Olympics are postponed to 2021 and the season we have been working towards for many years is no longer an option. Covid-19 has not only put dreams on hold for athletes, but it has forced them to slow down and process what this means for their life beyond sport. In the grand scheme of things, yes, this is secondary in comparison to global health, but for many athletes their sport is their life's work, and this blow will be felt on many levels.

<!-- excerpt -->

For a collegiate, they have based the culmination of their NCAA careers around this date, strategizing when to peak in order to entice shoe companies and obtain the coveted professional running contract. Athletes aspiring to be parents have based starting/building their families around this cycle, putting all their effort towards one dream before they begin another. Other pros have oriented their retirement from sport around the games, stretching themselves financially only to realize they have yet another year to avoid drowning in expenses. Of course, coaches and athletes are familiar with preparing for challenging circumstances, but adapting to this new way life is not as simple as "build a bridge and get over it".

Three of our GCTC pros shared their thoughts on these major changes, and how Covid-19 has affected their day to day lives and overall perspective. Elite level or not, we are all affected by these limitations and are navigating through it the best we can.

##### Sarah Pagano:

Uncertainty is in the air for all of humanity right now. My heart goes out to those severely effected physically and economically and my sincere thanks to those fighting on the front lines of this. This pandemic has made “my world” of running feel very minuscule in comparison to countless other things. That being said, we are all united in the sense that our lives are changed by this in some way.

I feel that as athletes, we are primed for these moments, where we need to be adaptable and able to change our mentality to best fit the situation. My goal through all of this is to focus on positives. Extra time can be a positive as I have more time to focus on areas I can improve (there are always things to improve!). I had 2 very subpar and disappointing races this indoor season, and I was very much looking forward to another opportunity to get back in a race setting this spring. Instead, I will choose to focus on gaining confidence through my mindset and progression in training until I can compete again. I personally like to plan things out and create goals around races to motivate me, but I’ll have to work on creating new goals for the time being. Another positive is that I can potentially run some races in the fall that I might not have done otherwise (if races are being held by then). I love a good road race and if things don’t change, there will be plenty to choose from this fall!

With all the uncertainty, this temporary pause has forced some reflection on the things that I am confident and certain about. I have family and friends that I love, a coach I trust, teammates who inspire me, a beautiful city to call home, supportive adidas shoes on my feet, and big goals to chase. Those things haven’t changed and I’m incredibly thankful for that. Oh, and I am still able to head out the door and do something I love every day. That‘s a true blessing. I can wait for everything else.

##### Chris O'Hare:

A super disappointing 2019 left me with a burning desire to get back to my usual self for 2020 and make sure I am on the plane to Tokyo. This year started off fantastically, I had a great camp in San Diego with the team in January before we started racing. Coming out of indoors, I felt like I was in a great place and most importantly, moving forward with momentum into the outdoor season. Covid-19 had other ideas.

Once meets started to get cancelled, the next two weeks or so was full of anxiety. After the Olympics was officially postponed, it allowed me to relax a little and enjoy being home with my family. My biggest adjustment was accepting how much time we now have to get ready so I didn’t need to stress out as much which has made day to day life a lot easier. I took a week of cross training to reset a little and I am starting the building process again to get ready for a late track season hopefully at the end of the year.

The stay at home order has given me a renewed outlook on what it takes to be a full time stay at home parent. My mother in law who normally takes a lot of the babysitting duties is socially distancing for the safety of the kids. This has made day to day life a little different but my wife Meredith and I are managing so far:
I take care of the kids and get them breakfast most days while Meredith does her at home workout and gets ready for the day.
Then I go run and do my core & ancillary work before we switch again.
Meredith then works while I watch the boys and try to keep our house from looking like a war zone.
After lunch Meredith feeds Riley and tries to get him down for a nap while I get Ronan and myself down for a nap.
Then it’s my turn again till Meredith finishes work and we make dinner.
After dinner is bath time and bathtub swimming lessons for Ronan. Once we get the kids to bed, we clean up and get about an hour or so of relaxation before we crash.

A little different to most pro athletes but I wouldn’t change it for anything.

##### Heidi See:

It started to become clear at the beginning of March that our concrete plans for the season were showing some cracks. Cancelled races one after the other made it seem like the Olympics postponement was suddenly an option, but a wild idea to process nonetheless. Before social distancing rules were put in place, I remember group runs feeling a little flat, like we all knew something big was brewing and our lives were going to be thrown a curve ball.

For me, and many other athletes of course, the Olympics is the be all end all absolute dream. It's been the driving force for my longevity in this sport and what has dictated every big life decision. I've had this competitive drive and pressure on myself to achieve since kindergarten and I was that little girl that wrote down her future job as "professional runner". Over the course of 10 years I've moved cities (4 times) and countries (3 times) based on what environment helped me to be the best athlete I could. I've certainly failed, but I've also felt victory. I've deeply struggled, but I've had the time of my life. The sport has been very sporadic for me in its joys and sorrows, but this covid-19 is an unfamiliar challenge.

So how do you act when the timeline gets derailed? Are you even allow to feel sad when what is happening is so much bigger than just you and your sport? Ultimately I am confident in the support team I have and hopeful for my athletic goals in the future. Although obviously upsetting, this pandemic has forced me to look outside of the running bubble I often get stuck in. A couple examples for me are enrolling in online classes, checking in on my friends/family more, and figuring out what small gestures I can offer to be helpful to others. With that said though, I still have days that I feel sad or unmotivated, and I think that's ok too. Dealing with any sort of loss is never linear, and I know that fire is still in me and it'll spark back up when the time comes.

**Hang in there, running friends! Our sport is very valuable to us all, but it is not the only thing that defines us. We have time to reflect/reset, and then the opportunity to come back stronger. Let's slow down now, so we can speed up later.**
